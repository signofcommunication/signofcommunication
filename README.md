👋 Hi, I'm Jhvonsky — a student at Matana University, majoring in Informatics Engineering, and currently working as a Frontend Developer.

🚀 In my free time, you'll find me:

Building side projects or diving into new tech related to web development and DevOps

Cruising around on my motorbike 🏍️

Playing games to unwind 🎮

🎧 Music is always with me — whether it's iconic Eminem tracks, epic movie soundtracks, or vibrant Japanese pop. I especially love the fusion of styles, like the works of Seven Oops — pure perfection ✨
