I am Jhvonsky, a student at Matana University majoring in Informatics Engineering. Currently, I am working at Matana University as an IT Intern and a multimedia coach at PT Digikidz.<br><br>In my free time, I usually either work on side projects or learn about new stuff related to web development and DevOps. Or I am just riding around with my motorbike and playing games.<br><br>I almost always listen to music whenever I can. My taste ranges from Eminem masterpieces or movie soundtracks to catchy Japanese popular music. The combinations of the two, like pieces by Seven Oops, are simply perfection ‚ú®
